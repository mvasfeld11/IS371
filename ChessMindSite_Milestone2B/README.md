In this milestone, I made my application modular. In essence, I modified what I had from
milestone 2a to make your application a “single page” application. At the end of this deliverable, my
application contains only one HTML file (home.html) and the design has been done through Bulma.
To convert your existing application into a single
page, I relied on Javascript to dynamically load content on the page.
