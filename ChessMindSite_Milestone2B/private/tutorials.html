          <h2 class="title">Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            Chess is a two-player strategy game played on a checkered board with
            64 squares arranged in an 8x8 grid. Each player starts with 16
            pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops,
            and eight pawns. The goal of the game is to checkmate the opponent's
            king, which means the king is in a position to be captured and
            cannot escape capture on the next move.
          </p>
          <h2 class="title">Pieces and Movement</h2>
          <p>
            The king can move one square in any direction. The queen can move
            any number of squares diagonally, horizontally, or vertically. The
            rook can move any number of squares horizontally or vertically. The
            knight moves in an L-shape pattern, two squares in a horizontal or
            vertical direction and then one square in a perpendicular direction.
            The bishop moves any number of squares diagonally. Pawns can move
            one or two squares forward on their first move and one square
            forward on subsequent moves, and can only capture diagonally.
          </p>
          <h2 class="title">Gameplay</h2>
          <p>
            The game begins with white moving first. Players take turns moving
            their pieces with the goal of putting the opponent's king in
            checkmate. If a player's king is under attack, they must make a move
            to get out of check. If a player's king is not in check but they
            have no legal move, the game is a draw. The game can also end in a
            draw by mutual agreement, stalemate, threefold repetition, or the
            50-move rule.
