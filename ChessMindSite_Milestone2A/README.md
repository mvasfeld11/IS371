This milestone is about setting the structure of your site. All my HTML and CSS is  complete.  All the features
that my site supports is more or less  identified after the completion of this milestone.
For example, the site navigation, header, footer, links, and images are  complete as part of this
milestone. My site looks more or less organized and easy to navigate. Links have been tested.
